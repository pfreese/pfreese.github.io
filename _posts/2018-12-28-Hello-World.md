Starting (and hoping it will stick!) a blog at the end of 2018 - stay tuned for posts about Bioinformatics papers and much more!

This website & blog was initialized following [these instructions by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), with the addition of blog tags from [these instructions by Long Qian](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).
