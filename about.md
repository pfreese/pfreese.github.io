Hi, I'm Peter Freese, a computational biologist at <a href="https://www.grail.com" target="blank">Grail new tab</a> [GRAIL](https://www.grail.com), a healthcare company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured.

I was previously an Applied Mathematics-Biology major at Harvard College (class of 2012), and did my PhD in Chris Burge's lab through the MIT Computational and Systems Biology Program (CSB), where I developed novel computational algorithms for interpreting and integrating various next-generation sequencing data types from assays probing protein-RNA interactions.
