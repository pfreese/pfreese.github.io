Hi, I'm Peter Freese, a computational biologist at <a href="https://www.grail.com" target="_blank">Grail</a>, a healthcare company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured.

I was previously an <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/applied-mathematics" target="_blank">Applied Mathematics</a> concentrator (with an area of focus in Biology) at Harvard College (class of 2012), and did my PhD in the lab of <a href="http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/" target="_blank">Prof. Chris Burge</a> through the <a href="http://csbi.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Computational and Systems Biology (CSB) Program</a>, where I developed novel computational algorithms for <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(18)30351-4" target="_blank">analyzing</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/05/179648" target="_blank">integrating</a> various next-generation sequencing data types from assays probing protein-RNA interactions.
